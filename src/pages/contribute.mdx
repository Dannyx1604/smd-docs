# Contribute to the project

Our goal is to find, write and upload the relevant high-quality information into a single place, before we let you run riot there's a couple of ground rules this page aims to cover. 

### Contribution Guidelines

At this stage of the project the scope is significantly smaller to ensure we cover every area as accurately as possible.

</ul>

### Style Guidelines

Currently we request all documents follow our below styling format, you can find an example file <a href="https://github.com/setupmd/templates/blob/main/Docs/blank.md">here</a> which can be downloaded from our templates repository.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title Tags</strong> - For unification, all titles should use the below when it comes to marking up headers</li>
  <li><strong>Headings</strong> - Headings should use a single hashtag and there should be no more than one per page</li>
  <li><strong>Sub-Headings</strong> - Subheadings should use either 3, 4 or 5 hashtags depending on how nested they are</li>
</ul>
  <p>Example formatting below</p>

  ```yml
  ... 

  # Title
  ### Sub-Heading
  #### Sub-Sub-Heading
  #### Sub-Sub-Heading Two
  ##### Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading

  ... 
  ```
<ul>
  <li><strong>Separator Lines</strong> - When using multiple 'three-hash' sub-headings you must use a single line break to signify there is a change within the pages contents</li>
</ul>
<p>Example formatting below</p>

```yml
... 

....this is the final sentence of the previous section.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Blocks</strong> - Must be used when breaking down config files or displaying single lines of code that users are expected to put into a command line</li>
</ul>

# Show other plugins commands in help.
non-ess-in-help: true
 
# Hide plugins which do not give a permission.
# You can override a true value here for a single plugin by adding a permission to a user/group.
# The individual permission is: essentials.help.(plugin), anyone with essentials.* or '*' will see all help regardless.
# You can use negative permissions to remove access to just a single plugins help if the following is enabled.
hide-permissionless-help: true

...
```

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strikethrough</strong> - Strikethrough can be used to signify redundant information that no longer holds true in the latest release but may still be relevant in previous releases</li>
  <li><strong>Info Blocks</strong> - Info blocks should be used when audience needs their attention drawn to a specific point within the document.</li>
</ul>
