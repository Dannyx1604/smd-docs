# SETUP.MD

Welcome to my brain dump, I've set myself a goal of gradually dumping 10 years worth of Minecraft server knowledge into this one central repository.

My goal is to intially cover the main core areas within setting up a Multiplayer environment for hosting your own Minecraft server.

The initial topics covered by this document are as follows: 

### Deploying a server
<ul>
	<li>Difference between a plugin vs mod</li>
	<li>Why plugins and mods should not be used together</li>
	<li>Why platforms jars like Moihst are a bad idea</li>
</ul>

### Understanding config files
This section will help you understand the basic variables within all of these files and what each one of them does and the impact of adjusting the value higher or lower.
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the server.properties file</li>
	<li>Understadning the bukkit.yml file</li>
	<li>Understanding the spigot.yml file</li>
	<li>Understanding the paper.yml file</li>
	<li>Understanding the purpur.yml file</li>
</ul>
