# A Special Thanks

Running an open source project isn't cheap so when companies agree to give us a hand absorbing a portion of their monthly subscription(s) it means a lot to us. If you're an organisation that would be willing to contribute some resources then please reach out to webmaster[@]setup.md 

This list is produced in the order from newest to oldest.
