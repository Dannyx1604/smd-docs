# Device Hardening

Depending on how 'public' your instances are going to be you can get away with more or less hardening, we will be securing our instances to a level accepted to hold 'OFFICIAL' data. More information about sensitivity levels we have chosen to use can be found [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/286667/FAQ2_-_Managing_Information_Risk_at_OFFICIAL_v2_-_March_2014.pdf).


### NCSC Guidelines 

Our gudielines that we have chosen to use are published straight from the NCSC and we can easily apply them using Group Policy and for our Ubuntu servers they provide a single post-install.sh script that we can run. These gudielines should be a 'guide' and are not definitive, you can chose to go beyond if deemed necessary for your workloads and/or local laws.

#### Windows Policies 

If you're using a Professional / Enterprise version of Windows you can download the GPOs from [here](https://github.com/ukncsc/Device-Security-Guidance-Configuration-Packs/raw/main/Microsoft/Windows/GPO/NCSC_Windows_GPO.zip) and upload them to your environment making adjustments as needed.

#### Ubuntu Script

If you're using Ubuntu you should download the following files from the repo [here](https://github.com/ukncsc/Device-Security-Guidance-Configuration-Packs/tree/main/Linux/UbuntuLTS) and manually run them on the device.
