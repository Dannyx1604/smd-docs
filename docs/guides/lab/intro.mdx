# Our Lab

In the process of making our project better to work on one of our first tasks was ensuring all our contributors had access to a clean workspace when they needed it. This encouraged the development of our 'Lab' environment that consists of the following hardware:

<ul>
    <li>x2 E-2386G Xeon CPUs</li>
    <li>64GB DDR4 3200Mhz RAM</li>
    <li>1 TB NVMe SSD</li>
</ul>

The above hardware was chosen with one important factor in mind. VM lifespan is relatively short and while high-core count and large ram capacity servers are great, we don't have the demand for that caliber of server.

:::note
If you also select OVHCloud as your provider, vRACK support is NOT offered on their Rise or ECO ranges.

### Cloud Provider 

We chose to utilise 'OVH' for a few reasons highlighted below, yes other hosting providers can also deliver on a few of the points listed at the time of enquiring only OVH was able to deliver all of them.

<ul>
    <li> Hardware - Current-gen Xeon-E CPUs</li>
    <li> Location - London, UK</li>
    <li> Price - Cheap IPv4 addresses & summer sale hardware deal</li>
    <li> Software - OVH is an official Proxmox hosting partner</li>
</ul>

### Software Used

This is a brief summary of the application stack we're utilising to make the Lab environment work for our needs, most are not required but the ones that are have been highlighted with a ✔ symbol

Required | Tool | Purpose | Alternatives | Summary
------------ |------------ | ------- | -------- | -------
✔ | Proxmox | Hypervisor | HYPER-V, ESXI | Proxmox was the easiest solution to get up and running without the need for ESXi hosts and enhanced Windows configuration.
✔ | Sophos XG | Firewall | pfSense, OpnSense | Product familiarity and ease of use compared to other OSS products, support included with all licenses.
 | Windows Server | Domain Controller | None | Utilises AD w/ AAD Sync and provides DHCP and DNS for the network.
✔ | Docker | Containerisation | k8s | Containers are much lighter than running full blown VMs for every application.
✔ | Portainer | Management | Rancher | Management interface for Docker containers utilising M365 Auth.
 | Nginx Proxy Manager | Reverse Proxy | Apache2, Caddy | NPM is a docker file ready to go purpose built for our needs.
 | InfluxDB | Monitoring | Prometheus | Ingest server for event logs and live data.
 | Grafana | Monitoring | None | Viewing data in nice fancy formats and sending alerts to webhooks.
 | Homer | QoL | Heimdall | Single pane of glass for shortcuts to services.
