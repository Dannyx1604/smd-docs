# Suggestion System

If you would like to help us improve this project, you can submit a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/setupmd/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature-request.yml) and the documentation can be implemented. If you have written your own documentation please submit a pull request with your changes and a member of the project will review it.

Users with a successful pull request can request the 'contributor' role within Discord.

With the introduction of free VMs for contributors you can also create a ticket from the `#lounge` channel using the `-vm` command.
