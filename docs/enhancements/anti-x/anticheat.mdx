# Anti-Cheat

:::info
Throughout this guide 'Anti-Cheat(s)' may be referred to as 'AC' or 'ACs'
:::

ACs are an integral part of any public server and help with catching hackers, since Minecraft's built-in anti-cheat is practically useless, it's better to turn it off than to endure the constant false positives it spews out. 

You should change the following settings within the  `server.properties` file.

```yml
...

allow-flight=true

...

```

Within the `spigot.yml` file you should also set the following values.

```yml
...

     moved-wrongly-threshold: 100000.0
     moved-too-quickly-multiplier: 100000.0
     
...
```

:::warning
We highly discourage the usage of auto-bans as no anti-cheat is perfect. If you want to auto-ban, consider having something like AntiCheatReplay so that you can undo false bans.

#### Spartan

##### Pros
  - 14-day money-back guarantee
  - Good Bedrock Checks. I wouldn't go as far as saying that you should auto-ban for violations, though
  - Decent movement checks.

##### Cons
  - EUR 22.49
  - Relatively poor combat checks
  - Absolutely obliterates server performance, often eating >20% of the ticks when scaled to higher player counts. Do not use if you have a large server

### Recommendations

Personally, I recommend that you use Vulcan or Astro as your anti-cheat, as both perform quite well while being somewhat cheap. Astro will be a bit less resource-intensive, while Vulcan has slightly better checks & will be getting Geyser checks soon. If you're looking for a Geyser anti-cheat and don't mind poor performance (at larger player counts), consider using Spartan Bedrock Edition (or waiting for Vulcan V3).

Remember, no anti-cheat is perfect. Players will be able to bypass anti-cheats, so we recommend having a moderator or two online to keep an eye out for any cheaters.
