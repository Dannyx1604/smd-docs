Worldedit is a no-brainer, this is a plugin that's been around for the entire lifespan of Minecraft multiplayer as we know it and it's not going anywhere fast. If you need to move large buildings in your world, export or import schematics this is the tool for you and your build team. Consider using WETS (WorldEdit Tick Spreader) OR AsyncWorldEdit OR FastAsyncWorldEdit, as they can perform tasks faster & prevent crashes.

Ironically, FAWE performs far worse than WE when idle due to unnecessary player interaction checks, at least when scaled to higher player counts. If you want to squeeze every last drop of performance out of your server and are not actively using FAWE in any way, switch back to WE.
