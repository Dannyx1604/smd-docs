Worldedit is a no-brainer, this is a plugin that's been around for the entire lifespan of Minecraft multiplayer as we know it and it's not going anywhere fast. If you need to move large buildings in your world, export or import schematics this is the tool for you and your build team. Consider using WETS (WorldEdit Tick Spreader) OR AsyncWorldEdit OR FastAsyncWorldEdit, as they can perform tasks faster & prevent crashes.
