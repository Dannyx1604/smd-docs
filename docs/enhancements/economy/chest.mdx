This section takes a look at current plugins that use craft-able chests for economy based tasks.

### Chest Shops
These solutions encourages more direct player to player interaction, these solutions aren't automated and rely on your end users buying and selling between one another.

#### QuickShop
Easily the best Chest Shop plugin, containing pretty much every feature you might need. I highly recommend that you use this.

#### ChestShop
A simpler chest shop plugin that still has plenty of solid features. Also a very good choice.

#### DukesMart
Super basic Chest Shop plugin which uses Gold Ingots as a currency. Terra-Opus is making a fork with a couple good changes so that might be worth checking out.
