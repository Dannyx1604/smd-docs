This section takes a look at current plugins that have a user-interface for economy based tasks.


### Active Solutions
Auction & Bidding plugins allow players to list their own items up for sale in a GUI. A necessity for most economy-based servers.

#### AuctionHouse
A decent /ah plugin. Unfortunately, it does have it's fair share of issues. For example, it is one of the most laggiest plugins in every server I've seen and also has caused dupes here and there (Rare, though.). There are better options out there with far more customizability.

#### PlayerAuctions
Easily the best /ah plugin I've ever used. It has extreme levels of customizability and flexibility, to the point where you can edit pretty much every aspect of every single menu. It also has compatibility with lots of other plugins and also an amazing author who is always there to provide support. Only issue it has at the very moment is that it isn't open source. Highly recommend it as long as you don't mind it being close sourced.

#### PlayerShops (BSP)
It allows every player to create their own shop GUI, similarly to BossShopPro. Players may sell their items in said shop. Might replacement for ChestShops. this plugin hasn't been updated in a while, though. Look for an updated fork instead.

#### zAuctionHouse
Player Auctions, but paid. Might have better performance than PA and a couple extra features, notably the Shulker viewer and a Sell inventory, but that's about it. Also, Player Auctions listed in the comparison page says that several features, such as multi-currency support & custom inventories, are not in PA. This is not true as PA does have said features.
