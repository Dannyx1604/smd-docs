Sometimes you can have issues at the first hurdle, getting your server to boot. Some of these issues are to do with your Java deployment and we will cover some quick fixes to get you up and running.

### Missing PATH variable

### Memory allocation

### Wrong version of Java installed

When it comes to the 'wrong version installed' there's a few factors to consider.

- Bit edition (x86 or x64 or ARM etc)
- Major LTS revision

You can identify if you're having issues due to the bit version by lowering the start-up args from a value greater than `4` for -Xms and -Xmx. If your server boots without issues to the `Done in X seconds` line you will need to uninstall your java release and download the 64 bit edition as this doesn't have the 4GB RAM memory limitation.

If your server still doesn't boot after decreasing the RAM it's most likely that your machine has the wrong edition of Java installed, certain major releases of Java dropped legacy builds as time has gone on.

The most commonly adopted Java releases are as follows:

- Java 8 (LTS)
- Java 11 (LTS)
- Java 17 (LTS)
- Java 19 (LTS)
