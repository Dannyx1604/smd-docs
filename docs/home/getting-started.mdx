# Welcome to the brain

This is where you'll spend most of your time within our repository, the brain contains everything that isn't a tutorial.

In having a central repository our goal is for unification and ease of access all of which is upheld by reliable project contributors, this project is not just the work of one but many so a huge thank you to everyone who has every contributed, shared or used our repository.

We're currently in the root of the website or `/` for short but for those editing this page on Github you're probably in `/docs/home/getting-started.mdx`.

Within this folder there are multiple directories, each one of these represents a 'top-level' conversation for a specific purpose as explained below.
