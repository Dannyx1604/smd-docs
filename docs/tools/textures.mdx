# Resource Pack Hosting

If you're looking to host your texture pack for your Minecraft community you can use a third party file hosting service to deliver your pack to Minecraft clients.

We (setup.md) have an official sharing site that can be used (for free) providing your packs are under 100MB in size.

### Using our uploader 

Firstly, open a browser and navigate to https://ugc.setup.md/upload.

Ensure your resource pack is in a .zip format, from here drag and drop the files into the uploader. You can also click the box and upload through the file explorer manually.

You will then see the files ready to be uploaded, from here you will need to select the 'Share' button.

Upon selecting 'Share' you will be presented a box that has a few variables we will need to change.

The two values you should consider changing are:

- Link
- Duration

#### Link

This is the URL of the share and it should be something you'll remember if you set this to a 'permanent' share as you'll be able to come back here any time to grab the download URL. You can also have this as auto-generated by pressing the button to the right.

#### Duration 

It's recommended you set this to `never expire` unless you don't mind re-uploading your pack every few days / months.

Select 'Share' and your files will start the uploading process, once your files have uploaded you should see a page like the one below.

Select the 'link' icon next to the 'download icon' to copy the download link to clipboard.

Go into your `server.properties` file and where it has resource-pack paste in the one from ugc.setup.md like so.
