# Service Monitoring

Knowing when your services go down is a must, you have multiple options when it comes to this requirement either in the form of SaaS or self-hosted. In following on with the nature of this project a self-hosted instance will be deployed.

### What is Uptime Kuma?

If you're completely new to monitoring products Uptime Kuma is basically a self-hosted version of Uptime Robot (which is also a great tool) and is hosted in the cloud. Uptime Robot does also offer a limited free tier which should be more than enough for a home lab environment.

### Requirements

- You have an instance of Docker already deployed

### Deploying in Docker

You can conver the docker run command from the github repo to a compose file manually or you can use the one below.

```yml
...

version: '3.8'

services:
  uptime-kuma:
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:1
    container_name: uptime-kuma
    volumes:
      - uptime-kuma:/app/data
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"  # <Host Port>:<Container Port>
    restart: always

volumes:
  uptime-kuma:

...
```

You should save the above configuration file as `docker-compose.yml`.

You can run the command `docker-compose up -d` from your terminal window to spin up the instance.
