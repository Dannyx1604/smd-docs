A section for optimizing Minecraft servers. Optimizing your server means to improve the performance of the server by implementing tweaks without heavily modifying desired mechanics. Advanced optimization is only recommended for large servers suffering from poor performance.

Topic | Summary
------------ | ------- 
Basic Optimization | Tweaks that will likely suffice for small to medium-sized servers (<100 Players) assuming that they are run on a good CPU.
Advanced Optimization | Tweaks made for larger servers with at least 150 players.
