title: Introduction
---

A section for optimising Minecraft servers. Optimising your server means to improve the performance of the server by implementing tweaks without heavily modifying desired mechanics. Advanced optimisation is only recommended for large servers suffering from poor performance.

### Spark Profiler
You should use the Spark Profiler for monitoring server performance e.g. vanilla mechanics, plugins, GC pauses and cycles, memory usage etc.

### Server JAR
Pufferfish is currently the fastest, most stable free Paper fork available. Another alternative would be Purpur, which provides additional mechanics for players at the expensive of rather negligible performance loss against Pufferfish. Velocity is the best option for the proxy. Although it doesn't have as many plugins as Bungeecord, it is far more stable and secure by default. Most important plugins have already added support for Velocity.


Topic | Summary
------------ | ------- 
Basic Optimisation | Tweaks that will likely suffice for small to medium-sized servers (<100 Players) assuming that they are run on a good CPU.
Advanced Optimisation | Tweaks made for larger servers with at least 150 players.
