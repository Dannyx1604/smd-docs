# Welcome

> [!Warning]
> **SETUP.MD IS NOT PRODUCTION READY**
> We're actively working on adding content, clarity and more to this site but in the meantime you can checkout the [Admincraft](https://discord.gg/admincraft) Discord server for support and advice.

This is setup.md, a single pane of glass for all your Minecraft server administration needs. The goal of this website is to collate as much useful information for novice server owners in one place as possible. We know that this site won't contain **everything** but our goal is to cover as much as we physically can.


If you need assistance with a topic we don't don't yet cover head on over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pXaQgzneed) server where you can ask for assistance, suggest document additions / changes and bounce ideas of other server owners.


### Topic Breakdowns

This site will get quite hectic but there's a couple of solid ways to navigate your way around. The first option is to always use the spider diagram on the right hand side of this page, anytime we link to another document within a page it will create a spider diagram of things to checkout.

The second method of searching is the search bar, if you type in terms like 'LuckPerms' or 'Oracle' you'll find previous pages that we've written however if it doesn't appear chances are we've either used different terms or we don't have a document for it yet.

Finally the last option is to manually search each section using the below as reference guides to the main index file of each category. 

#### Section 1 - Deploying a Server

This section is for those who are starting from fresh. We cover topics such as identifying your tools, understanding the difference between a 'paper server' and a 'modded server' all the way through to picking the right hosting environment, deploying your server and troubleshooting common deployment errors you could come across.

To get started you can [click here](1-deploying-a-server/getting-started.md).

#### Section 2 - Understanding Config Files

The next section is for those who are now up and running with a basic server but are looking to make adjustments to gameplay mechanics. This section includes a breakdown into he default files of a Minecraft server in addition to understanding 'YML' plugin configuration files.

To get started you can [click here](2-understanding-config-files/readme.md).

#### Section 3 - Server Enhancements

The final section of our introductory guide is enhancing your server, this will cover the basics about plugins including some recommendations to get your started. This section will also briefly cover topics such as proxies and how they can be used to build end results such as [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net).

To get started you can [click here](3-server-enhancements/readme.md).
