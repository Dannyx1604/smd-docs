# SETUP.MD

Welcome to 'the brain', this is a community knowledge repository with a single goal of unifying knowledge allowing novice Minecraft server owners to make informed decisions along with how-to style tutorials.

The initial phase of this project is data consolidation and defining frameworks / standards that will be used throughout this knowledgebase. For those looking to contribute the below will have information on the formatting, PR process and more.


### Contributions

Ensuring a unified standard for all KB articles is essentials, without this formatting will break on https://brain.setup.md. (The web interface for this repository.) We're using [obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes) for our front end and therefore require their styling formats are used.


#### Style Guide

This section outlines all that is required when it comes to documentation styling.

<ul>
	<li>Single '#' titles - These should exist once per-page at the very first line.</li>
	<li>Triple '#' titles - These can exist multiple times throughout a document and should be used for any 'sub-headings'.</li>
	<li>Quadruple '#' titles - These can also exist multiple times throughout a document and should be used for any additional 'sub-headings' already existing within a 'sub-section'.</li>
</ul>
