# Panels
If you're running a Minecraft server the chances are you'll want an easier method of management, this is where panels come into play. Every [shared hosting](/1-deploying-a-server/_hosting/types-of-hosting#Shared+Hosting) provider will come with a control panel, this is how you'll interface with your server normally at a URL similar to https://panel.mydomain.com. Depending on how long the provider has been in business they'll either be using Multicraft or Pterodactyl (newer hosts using the latter). 

While Multicraft and Pterodactyl became the widely adopted platforms for Minecraft hosting this doesn't mean they're the only players in the game and with a VPS / Bare Metal you can install any one of a number of different solutions. We could write this article for the next six months documenting every single different panel and why it should be used but we're going to focus on a couple.

### Panels in Focus

The top 4 shortlisted panels this article will be covering are.
- AMP
- Multicraft
- Pterodactyl
- Puffer panel

#### AMP

AMP is a licensed panel produced by CubeCoders which supports both Windows and multiple Linux distros including Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Cent OS and more. CubeCrafters are by no means new to the hosting game, their previous product McMyAdmin launched all the way back in 2013.

At this time there is **NO** Apple builds so for legacy McMyAdmin2 users this product may not be suitable for you unless you're running boot camp or run your servers on a different machine.
