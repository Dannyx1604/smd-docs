# SFTP

When running a Minecraft server remotely the chances are at some stage you'll want to adjust some files, upload a plugin or download / export your world for migration. This page will cover how to use SFTP for 'Multicraft' and 'Pterodactyl' panels, while the base steps will be very fundamentally similar the web interfaces where to find the information is different.

### Multicraft Specific
These steps are Multicraft specific in order to configure access for FTP.

- Go to your providers control panel, normally https://panel.provider.com
- Select the server you want to give FTP access to
- Go to the 'Users' tab
- Find the user you wish to grant FTP access to and in the middle column use the dropdown to grant one of the following options.

	- No Access
	- Read Only
	- Full Access
	
> [!Note]
> Beside the dropdown you will see a username, make a note of this as you'll need it for later.
